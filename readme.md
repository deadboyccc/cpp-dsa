# C++ Learning Journey

Hey there! Welcome to my C++ playground! This repo is all about my journey diving deep into C++ and playing around with different algorithms and data structures. It's been a wild ride, so buckle up and enjoy the chaos!

## What You'll Find Here

- **Sorting Algorithms**: From bubble sort to quicksort, I've tried to sort it all out.
- **Data Structures**: Linked lists, binary search trees, heaps, and more. If it's a data structure, it's probably here(almost).
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, and Kruskal's algorithms. Graph theory is fun, right?
- **Miscellaneous**: A mix of other algorithms and data structures that didn't fit neatly into the above categories.

## A Word of Caution

This codebase is a bit of a mess. It's a draft, a learning tool, and a place where I experimented with different concepts. So, if you decide to dive in, do so with caution. You might find some rough edges, but hey, that's part of the charm!

## Stay Safe!

Remember, this code was written with learning in mind. It's not production-ready, and it might contain some... interesting bugs. So, stay safe, have fun, and maybe wear a helmet. ðŸ˜‰

Happy coding!
## How to Use This Repo

Feel free to clone, fork, or just browse through the code. If you find something cool or weird, drop a comment or open an issue. I'm always up for a chat about C++ and algorithms!

##Cmake Notes
### CMake Notes

This project uses CMake to manage the build process. CMake helps in organizing the code, managing dependencies, and ensuring that the project can be built on different platforms with ease. The `CMakeLists.txt` file includes configurations for setting up the project, specifying the required C++ standard, and linking necessary libraries. Using precompiled headers (PCH) can significantly reduce compilation times by precompiling frequently included headers.

To build the project:
1. Install CMake.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `cmake .` to generate the build files.
4. Run `make` (or the equivalent command on your platform) to compile the project.

Happy building!

Enjoy the chaos and happy coding! ðŸš€
